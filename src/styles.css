/* JOBTRACKER STYLES - MODULAR CSS SYSTEM */
/* ============================================================================ */
/*
 * This file serves as the main entry point for all styles.
 * 
 * The CSS has been split into modular files for better maintainability:
 * 
 * - base.css:       Variables, colors, typography, resets
 * - layout.css:     Containers, headers, basic structure
 * - components.css: Buttons, forms, modals, UI components
 * - table.css:      Table layout, inline editing, data display
 * 
 * For development, you can work with individual files.
 * The build process combines them into a single file for production.
 */

/* This file is intentionally minimal to save tokens when reading.
   All styles are now in the modular files listed above. */

/* If you need to add any styles that don't fit the above categories,
   add them here temporarily and then move them to the appropriate
   modular file. */
